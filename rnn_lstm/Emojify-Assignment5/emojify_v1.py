'''
 What you should remember from this part:
    -Even with a 127 training examples, you can get a reasonably good model for Emojifying. This is due to the generalization power word vectors gives you.
    -Emojify-V1 will perform poorly on sentences such as "This movie is not good and not enjoyable" because it doesn't understand combinations of words--it just averages all the words' embedding vectors together, without paying attention to the ordering of words. You will build a better algorithm in the next part.
